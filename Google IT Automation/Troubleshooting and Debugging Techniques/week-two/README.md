# Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques - Week 2

## Understanding Slowness

The general strategy for addressing slowness is to **identify the bottleneck** for addressing slowness in  device, script, or system to run slowly.

Monitor the usage of resources to know which of them as being exhausted.

Top tool on Linux systems lets us see which currently running processes are using the most CPU time.

* There are other tools we can use like iotop and iftop

### Possible Causes for Slowness

When you can't modify the code of the program, try to **reduce** the size of the files involved

* If the file is a log file, you can use a program like logrotate to do this for you.

### Slow Web Server

Use a tool called **ab** which stands for **Apache Benchmark** tool to figure out how slow the server is

* Run ab -n 500 to get the average timing of 500 requests, and then pass a web address for the measurement

## Slow Code

### Writing Efficient Code

As a rule, aim first to write code that is to avoid bugs

* Readable
* Easy to maintain
* Easy to understand

If the code is not fast enough, tru to optimize by eliminating **expensive actions**, which are those that take a long time to complete.

* Trying to optimize every second out of a script is probably not worth the effort though

The first step is to keep in mind that we can't really make our computer go faster. If we want our code to finish faster, we need to make our computer do less work, and to do this, we'll have to 

1. Avoid doing work that isn't really needed
2. Avoid calculating data repeatedly by using the right data structures and storing the data
3. Reorganize the code so that the computer can stay busy while waiting for information from slow sources like disk or over the network

Use a **profiler** tool to measure the resources that the code is using for better understanding of what's going on. It allows us to see which functions are called by our program, how many times each function was called and how much time are programs spent on each of them.

Because of how profilers work, they are specific to each programming language

* C program uses gprof to analyze
* Python uses c-Profile module to analyze

### Using the Right Data Structures

Using an appropriate data structures can help us avoid unnecessary expensive operations and create efficient scripts.

**Lists** are sequences of elements that can

* Add, remove, or modify the elements in them
* Iterate through the whole list to operate on each of the elements

When adding or removing elements,

* Adding or removing elements **at the end** is fast
* Adding or removing elements in the middle can be slow because all the elements that follow need to be repositioned

When accesing or finding an element,

* Accessing an element in a specific position in the list is fast
* Acceessing an element in an unknown position requires going through the whole list
  * This can be super slow if the list is long

**Dictionary** store key value pairs that can

* Add data by associating a value to a key
* Retrieve a value by looking up a specific key

When accesing or finding an element,

* Looking up keys is very fast O(n)

In summary,

* If you need to access elements by position or will always iterate through all the elements, use a list
* If we need to look up the elements using a key, use a dictionary

Another thing that we might want to think twice about is creating copies of the structures that we have in **memory**.

### Expensive Loops

When using a loop, avoid doing expensive actions inside of the loop. If an expensive operation is performed inside a loop, you multiply the time it takes to do the expensive operation by the amount of times you repeat the loop.

* Make sure that the list of elements that you're iterating through is only as long as you really need it to be
* Break out of the loop once the data is found

## When Slowness Problems Get Complex

### Parallelizing Operations

Operatiing in **parallel** is one way to run scripts more efficiently.

* **Concurrency** is dedicated to how we write programs that do operations in parallel

When data needs to shared while using the OS to split the work and the processes, use **threads**.

* These processes don't share any memory by default

__Threads let us run parallel tasks inside a process__. This allows threads to share some of the memory with other threads in the same process.

To handle threads, modify the code to create and handle the thread.

* In Python, use the **Threading** or **AsyncIO** modules (each programming language hsa different implementations)

These modules let us specify which parts of the code we want to run in separate threads or as separate asynchronous events, and how we want the results of each to be combined in the end

If your script is mostly just waiting on input or output, also known as I/O bound, it might matter if it's executed on one processor or eight.
